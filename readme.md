# introduction
This is my config of sublime text 3. 

# Usage
1. Install Sublime Text3.
2. Install [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation).
3. Clone this repository into: *\<Sublime Text 3\>/\<Packages\>* and named "User". You can find out the directory by openting the setting file: Preference-->Setting.
4. Check the permission of your new folder *User*. It needs write permission.
